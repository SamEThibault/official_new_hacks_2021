## Inspiration
- With the goal of creating a truly useful product, we met up to reflect on areas of struggle in our own lives.
- We noticed that our faculty had trouble recruiting student note takers to help students with accommodations.

## What it does
- We decided to create an app that allows students to share their electronic notes with whoever might need them.

## How we built it
- We built the web application using React, Firebase and Redux
- The frontend was created with React
- The serverless backend was Firebase
- Redux was used to manage the state of all of the components

## Challenges we ran into
- We faced a steep learning curve since most of us have never used ReactJs nor collaborated on Github.
- Material UI uses CSS files to format their objects to specific standards, it took a lot of playing around to format boxes and cards the way we needed them to look.
- Collaborating on GitHub posed challenges since we used many additional packages so the JSON file would be drastically different for each branch.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud that we were able to learn a bunch of new technologies and skills about web development in such a short amount of time.
- We are proud that we were effective and efficient as a team in terms of communication and collaboration.

## What we learned
- We learned technologies such as React, Git, Github, Redux, Firebase, and NPM 

## What's next for NoteHacks
- We plan on making the product more refined in terms of security, the discussion board, and improving the overall design and functionality.
